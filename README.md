# Kleur UI

A Tailwind color scheme generator for users to quickly and easily create custom color schemes for their web design projects.

The tool uses hex color codes to generate the 10 shades of color that are typically required for a Tailwind theme. These shades can be used for different elements on a website, such as headings, text, backgrounds, and buttons.

The color scheme generator allows users to input a base color and automatically generates the corresponding shades, saving time and effort in the design process. It is a useful tool for both designers and developers who want to create cohesive, visually appealing websites.
